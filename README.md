# Adoption Landing Page

I want to refine my frontend skills using React and Tailwind so I can be more confident using other methods of CSS, but also creating responsive webpages. I also don't want to use pre-made components, and are all made myself.

Currently it is a little bare bones, but I will work on it bit by bit every day.

Current progress:
- A responsive navigation menu.

Future plans:
- Add drop downs to each menu category for more options.
